\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

This document ... \wss{provide an introductory blurb and roadmap of the
  Verification and Validation plan}

\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

\wss{Say what software is being tested.  Give its name and a brief overview of
  its general functions.}

\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Relevant Documentation}

\wss{Reference relevant documentation.  This will definitely include your SRS
  and your other project documents (design documents, like MG, MIS, etc).  You
  can include these even before they are written, since by the time the project
  is done, they will be written.}

\citet{SRS}

\wss{Don't just list the other documents.  You should explain why they are relevant and 
how they relate to your VnV efforts.}

\section{Plan}

\wss{Introduce this section.   You can provide a roadmap of the sections to
  come.}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may include
  ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates, or you may plan for 
  something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsection{Design Verification Plan}

\wss{Plans for design verification}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Test Description}

This section will provide an outline of the various system tests that will be performed
by the team during development. The system tests will primarily be based on the requirements
recorded in the {https://github.com/r-yeh/grocery-spending-tracker/blob/master/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS}.
	
\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\subsubsection{Look and Feel Requirements}
		
% \paragraph{Title for Test} -- not sure if this needs to be used

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{NFRT-LF1\\}

  Type: Manual, Dynamic
            
  How test will be performed: Testers will be presented with the application and guided through navigation of various
  pages available and asked to take note of the aesthetics, appearance and feel of the application. A survey
  will then be provided to evaluate these qualities which can be found in Section 6.2 of this document.
            
  \item{NFRT-LF2\\}

  Type: Manual
            
  How test will be performed: Testers will be given a list of features for the application and a list of
  unlabelled icons corresponding to each of the features. They will be asked to match which feature
  they believe pairs with which icon.

  \item{NFRT-LF3\\}

  Type: Manual, Static

  How test will be performed: Walkthroughs will be performed on the code of each of the frontend pages
  using the \textit{Flutter Inspector} to check size of components and layouts. This will be to ensure no more than
  85\% of the page is occupied and a numerical balance is achieved in the layout.

  \item{NFRT-LF4\\}

  Type: Manual, Dynamic

  Initial State: Application is opened on a device and logged into a user's account with internet access available.

  Input: The user disconnects from the internet.

  Output: The application should notify the user that they do not have internet connection.

  How test will be performed: Testers will be asked to disconnect from the internet while the application is open.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Usability and Humanity Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{NFRT-UH1\\}

  Type: Manual, Dynamic
            
  How test will be performed: Testers will be presented with the
  application and given a brief overview of its purpose. They will then be given 15 minutes to use the application
  under supervision by the team but without instruction. After that time period, the testers will be asked to input
  a receipt and navigate to the purchase analytics.

  \item{NFRT-UH2\\}

  Type: Manual, Dynamic
					
  Initial State: Application is opened on a device and logged into a user's account with internet access available.
					
  Input: The user attempts to input a receipt but cancels the process.
					
  Output: No changes should be made to the user's account data.
  
  How test will be performed: Testers will be given a receipt to input and asked to input it into the application.
  Testers will then be asked to cancel the input before the process completes.

  \item{NFRT-UH3\\}

  Type: Manual, Dynamic
					
  Initial State: Application is opened on a device and logged into a user's account with internet access available.
					
  Input: The user tries changing the application's font size.
					
  Output: The font size should be changed throughout the application without negatively impacting readability
  or general functionality.
  
  How test will be performed: Testers will be asked to change the font size to their desired size and
  navigate through the application to check usability.

  \item{NFRT-UH4\\}

  Type: Manual, Dynamic
					
  Initial State: Application is opened on a device and logged in to a user's account with internet access available.
					
  Input: The user changes the accessibility colour scheme.
					
  Output: The colour scheme should be changed throughout the application without negatively impacting readability
  or general functionality.
  
  How test will be performed: Testers will be asked to change the accessibility colour scheme to their desired setting and
  navigate through the application to check usability.

  \item{NFRT-UH5\\}

  Type: Manual, Dynamic
					
  Initial State: Application is opened on a device and logged in to a user's account with accessibility settings
  being changed.
					
  Input: The user closes the application.
					
  Output: When re-opened, the application should still be logged into the user's account and accessibility
  settings should still be in place.
  
  How test will be performed: Testers will be asked to close the application on their device while logged in and
  re-open it afterwards.

  \item{NFRT-UH6\\}

  Type: Manual

  How test will be performed: A survey will be presented to testers to evaluate the overall usability of the
  application after they have tried it for 20 minutes. The questions asked will be as written in Section 6.3
  of this document.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Performance Requirements}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item{NFRT-PR1\\}

  Type: Manual, Dynamic

  How test will be performed: All major pages of the application will be navigated through while using the
  \textit{Flutter Performance Profiling} tools. Times for rendering and frontend loading will then be recorded
  to ensure that frontend performance is within expectation.

  \item{NFRT-PR2\\}

  Type: Automatic, Dynamic, Manual

  How test will be performed: Requests will be sent to all major backend endpoints via \textit{Postman} and after
  all requests are sent, the times for each request will be recorded. The team will then manually confirm that
  the backend performs within expectation.

  \item{NFRT-PR3\\}

  Type: Automatic, Dynamic

  Initial State: The backend server is running and operational.

  Input: For all endpoints, incorrect data types and incorrect inputs (such as empty inputs) will be passed.

  Output: The server should have appropriate error handling where no invalid data is accepted and the server
  remains operational.

  How test will be performed: A test suite with invalid data for the major endpoints will be created with
  \textit{Postman}. The test suite will then be automatically executed by \textit{Postman} and the results
  will be analyzed after.

  % Precision requirements here should refer to FR Tests above

  \item{NFRT-PR4\\}

  Type: Manual % would this be defined as a Static test?

  Initial State: Device is used that does not have the application installed.

  Input: Application is installed onto the device.

  Output: Device storage should indicate that the application uses less than 1GB of storage.

  How test will be performed: Tester will install the application onto a device without the application currently
  installed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State: 
					
Input: 
					
Output: \wss{The expected result for the given inputs}

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed:

Test Case Derivation: \wss{Justify the expected value given in the Output field}

How test will be performed: 

\item{...\\}
    
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Module 2}

...

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

  \item Were there any features that seemed out of place relative to the pages they were present on?
  \item Were there any places where you expected loading indicators but there weren't any or vice versa?
  \item Do you have any feedback on the overall look and feel of the application?
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Usability Survey Questions}

\wss{This section is not required for CAS 741}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
