\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

This document outlines the verification and validation plan for the Grocery Spending Tracker.
The document will cover some basic information about the application as well as go over the plans
the team has for testing its requirements and features throughout development. It will also cover
the different system tests and unit tests that the team will employ to go about validating
the software.

\section{General Information}

This section will give a general overview of the application as well as the objectives
the team has for performing validation and verification. This section will also include any
relevant document related to the overall testing plan.

\subsection{Summary}

The Grocery Spending Tracker is a mobile application being developed to help
users save money on groceries. The main feature is allowing users to input photos of receipts
which the application will then parse. Once parsed, the items and their corresponding prices will then be recorded.
This data will then be used to show analytics regarding their purchase history over time.
Additionally, the application will also allow users to get budgeting suggestions based on personal spending preferences
as well as recommendations for alternative nearby grocery stores where recently purchased items
can be obtained for cheaper.

\subsection{Objectives}

In regards to the application's primary functionality, testing will be done to build confidence
in the correctness and accuracy of all main features such as the OCR for receipt input as well as analytic
data being returned. This also holds for any budgeting suggestions and alternative grocery store suggestions.
Due to the nature of this application focusing on user finances, the accuracy and correctness of all
main features are paramount to this application's success.
Additionally, qualities that are important for an enjoyable user experience
will also be emphasized in this VnV Plan. Testing should verify that the application demonstrates
acceptable levels of usability and performance according to stakeholder expectations. \\

In general, a majority of the requirements set by the
\href{https://github.com/r-yeh/grocery-spending-tracker/blob/master/docs/SRS/SRS.pdf}{SRS} and
\href{https://github.com/r-yeh/grocery-spending-tracker/blob/master/docs/HazardAnalysis/HazardAnalysis.pdf}{HA} will be considered
during validation and verification. Maintainability, adaptability, and compliance tests however will be placed out of scope
due to them having less direct impact on the main user experience. Additionally, personalization settings
will be out of scope for testing as well due to them having less importance for the current build of the project. The primary focus during
this development period will be to build a prototype application with all primary features and qualities rather than a
full consumer product. With this in mind, these qualities seemed less relevant to this overall goal.
Additionally, several features will leverage external libraries as part of the overall workflow and these components will
be excluded from testing as well on a unit level. The team will assume that these libraries have already
been tested extensively by the original developers and other users.

How test will be performed: Tester will open the application and attempt to sign into an account with the pertaining credentials.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Receipt Scanning}

These tests pertain to all the functional requirements related to the scanning of receipts and inputting grocery data.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR3-1}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: User has physical receipt and the system has access to the device camera.
          
Input: A photo of a physical receipt. User takes photo of receipt with their device.
          
Output: User is provided with a list of all their grocery items and prices on the receipt as well as an option to manually enter or edit them.

Test Case Derivation: Assuming optimal conditions, the application should be able to capture the items and corresponding prices
of each. The user should then have the opportunity to review the data and make changes before submitting.
          
How test will be performed: In even lighting, tester will run the system and photograph a receipt. They will then validate that the systems interpretation of the photograph matches that of the physical receipt with above 90\% precision.

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR11-1}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: User has physical receipt and the system has access to the device camera.

Input: User scans a physical receipt in bad conditions.
          
Output: User is provided with a list of all the scanned grocery items and prices on the receipt with a strong recommendation to retake the photo in better conditions or manually enter or edit them.

Test Case Derivation: In poor lighting conditions where the receipt is not clearly visible by the camera, the application should still
attempt to scan the receipt but should prompt the user to retake the photo in better conditions to ensure accuracy of the data.
          
How test will be performed: In a dark environment, tester will run the system and photograph a receipt. They will then validate that the system prompts the user to retake the photo or manually review all scanned items.

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR11-2}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: User has no physical receipt.

Input: User prompts the system that they do not have a receipt to scan.
          
Output: User is prompted to manually enter their grocery items and prices.

Test Case Derivation: If the user does not have a usable receipt that they can scan, the system should allow users to manually
enter data if necessary.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will prompt the system interface that they have no receipt. Tester will validate they are able to manually enter their items.

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR11-3}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: The system does not have access to the device camera.

Input: User attempts to scan a receipt.
          
Output: User is prompted to give permissions for the application to access camera. If not given, user is asked to manually enter grocery items and prices.

Test Case Derivation: Without permissions, the application will not work properly. Therefore, the application should prompt the user to give
camera access and restrict users to manual receipt entry if not given.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will revoke application access to device camera and then attempt to scan a receipt. Verify that the system prompts the user for camera access and asks the user for manual input if not given.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Account Goals and Preferences}

These tests pertain to all the functional requirements related to the user's account preferences, goals, or details that affect the system's performance.

\paragraph{Location-based Recommendations}

These tests pertain to all the functional requirements related to the user's location and how it affects their grocery recommendations.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR4-1}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: The system does not have access to the user's device location.

Input: User prevents location access for the application
          
Output: User is prompted that the system has no location access and given the option to manually enter their general home location and desired recommendation radius.

Test Case Derivation: If the application is not given access to the device's location, then the application should allow for
manual entry by the user to prevent feature disruption.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will revoke application access to location  and then attempt to receive location-based grocery recommendations. Validate that system provides prompt.

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR4-2}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: The system has access to the user's device location but user wants to manually set a different one.

Input: User changes preferences to use manually entered home location and recommendation radius rather than device location.
          
Output: System provides accurate location-based recommendations regarding the manually entered location.

Test Case Derivation: If the user wishes to use a manually set location rather than their device's location, then the
application should still function the same in both scenarios.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will go to preferences and opt to use manually provided home location and recommendation radius. Validate that the system is providing correct grocery recommendations for the manually inputted location and radius.

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR4-3}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: The system has access to the user's device location.

Input: System has location access on device.
          
Output: Application provides recommendations to the user for stored that are within the default radius of their location.

Test Case Derivation: Should the application have access to the device location, then all location preferences should be
relative to the device's active location.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will enable location services for the application and validate that the system is providing correct grocery recommendations for the current device location.

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{User Objectives}

These tests pertain to all the functional requirements related to the user's goals and spending objectives.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR5-1}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: The system has no spending goals and desired outcomes stored in the system.

Input: User navigates to the preferences of their application.
          
Output: The system provides a space for the user to input their spending goals.

Test Case Derivation: The system must provide an interface for the user to input their spending goals.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will navigate to the application preferences and validate that an interface exists for inputting spending goals.

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR5-2}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: The system has existing spending goals and desired outcomes stored in the system. The system displayed the current spending goals.

Input: User navigates to the preferences of their application and changes their spending goals.
          
Output: The system is updated to reflect the new spending goals.

Test Case Derivation: If spending goals are ever updated, then the application should take the new spending goals into account
for correctness.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will navigate to the application preferences and validate that the existing spending goals are displayed. They will then attempt to change the values of the spending goals and then save the changes.

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR6-1}}

Initial State: The system has existing budgeting constraints stored.

Input: User navigates to the preferences of their application and changes their budgeting constraints.
          
Output: The system displays the new budgeting constraints.

Test Case Derivation: If budgeting constraints are ever updated, then the application should take the new constraints into account
for correctness.

How test will be performed: Tester will navigate to the application preferences and validate that the existing goals are displayed. They will then attempt to change the budgeting constraints values and save the changes.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{System Behaviour and Recommendations}

These tests pertain to all the functional requirements related to how the system responds to the data that is provided to it. This includes the recommendations provided to the user.

\paragraph{Receiving Grocery Data}

These tests pertain to all the functional requirements related to how the system shall treat and handle data it receives.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR7-1}}

Control: Automatic
          
Initial State: Test database is empty.

Input: API calls from client (front-end) to back-end containing receipt data. Receipt data is comprised of an array of \textit{Item(string name, double price, string date, string purchaseLocation, int userID)}.
          
Output: Database contains correctly organized items. The user's database table should include all items they purchased.

Test Case Derivation: System back-end must accurately map and sort receipt entries provided, keeping a record of the user who purchased each item.
          
How test will be performed: Begin with an empty testing database. Test cases comprised of items and prices are sent through an API call to the system back-end by testing client. Then an additional API call will be called from the testing client against the system back-end to validate that the items and prices are correctly stored in the database. \textit{Postman} will be used to facilitate API calls. 

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR7-2}}

Control: Automatic
          
Initial State: Test database is populated.

Input: API calls from client (front-end) to back-end containing receipt data. Receipt data only contains items that are not already in the database. Receipt data is comprised of an array of \textit{Item(string name, double price, string date, string purchaseLocation, int userID)}.
          
Output: System back-end must accurately map and sort receipt entries provided, keeping a record of the user who purchased each item while preserving existing data.

Test Case Derivation: System back-end must accurately map and sort receipt entries provided, keeping a record of each item all users purchase.
          
How test will be performed: Begin with a populated testing database. Test cases comprised of items and prices are sent through an API call to the system back-end by testing client. Then an additional API call will be called from the testing client against the system back-end to validate that the items and prices are correctly stored in the database. \textit{Postman} will be used to facilitate API calls. 

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR7-3}}

Control: Automatic
          
Initial State: Test database is populated.

Input: API calls from client (front-end) to back-end containing receipt data. Data containing items that are the same as existing items in the database but with different name identifiers.
An example of this would be a difference of "Rtz Crackers" or "Ritz Cracker". Receipt data is comprised of an array of \textit{Item(string name, int cents, double price, string purchaseLocation, int userID)}.
          
Output: Database contains correctly organized items and understanding the relationship between like items. If like products are added to the database, the database correctly maps them to the existing items of the same type, even if the name string is different. The database also keeps track of which users purchase items.

Test Case Derivation: System back-end must accurately map and sort receipt entries provided, keeping a record of the user who purchased each item while preserving existing data.
          
How test will be performed: Begin with a populated testing database. Test cases comprised of items and prices are sent through an API call to the system back-end by testing client. Then an additional API call will be called from the testing client against the system back-end to validate that the items and prices are correctly stored in the database. \textit{Postman} will be used to facilitate API calls. 

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Grocery Recommendations}

These tests pertain to all the functional requirements related to the system's grocery recommendations based on grocery data received from user and their preferences.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR8-1}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: User has set budget information.

Input: User submits a receipt containing commonly purchased items plus a new highly priced item that puts them over budget.
          
Output: The system should identify the newly purchased item as the cause for the user going over budget and will recommend that the user stop purchasing it. If available, the system will also recommend alternatives that are in-line with the user's budget.

Test Case Derivation: System must be aware of the users purchasing activity and budget. If the user ever goes over budget when entering
a receipt, the system should identify why they went over budget and offer some advice.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will input receipt meeting the above conditions. The tester will then validate that the new item is correctly identified as putting the user over budget and confirm if they get a recommendation for an alternative.

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR8-2}}

Control: Manual

How test will be performed: Survey is presented to the user for them to respond how useful the system recommendations are. A success is determined by at least a 70\% positive response. The survey question is detailed in \textit{Section 6.2.2}.

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR9-1}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: The database has an entry for a grocery item that is purchased from a location X.

Input: User inputs a receipt containing the grocery item in the database but at a higher price from location Y.
          
Output: System provides recommendation to purchase item from location X.

Test Case Derivation: System must be aware of the users purchasing activity and recommend the user with cheaper alternative locations for
the same item.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will submit items purchased for a cheap price on one user account (A) and then submit the same item purchased at a greater price from a different store with another user account (B). Tester verifies that user B receives a recommendation from the system to go to the same place as user A.

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR9-2}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: The database has an entry for a grocery item that is purchased from a location X.

Input: User submits a receipt containing the grocery item in the database but at a cheaper price from location Y.
          
Output: The database should be updated such that the cheapest price, location, and purchase date for that item are equal to the input data. Location Y should then be recommended to users who purchase that item.

Test Case Derivation: System must be aware of the users purchasing activity and recommend the user with cheaper alternative locations for
the same item.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will submit an item purchased for some amount on one user account (A) and then submit the same item for a cheaper amount from a different store with another user account (B). Tester verifies that user A receives a recommendation from the system to go to the same place as user B.

\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Grocery Items Interface}

These tests pertain to all the functional requirements related to the system's grocery item interface.

\begin{enumerate}

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR10-1}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: User has no spending data or submitted items.

Input: User submits a receipt.
          
Output: System provides an interface showing all purchased items along with price, location, and date-time.

Test Case Derivation: System must provide the user with all of the data that the user has provided the system such that the user can review their own purchasing data.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will submit a receipt and then verify to see that the items have been added in the purchases interface.

\item{\textbf{FRT-FR10-2}}

Control: Manual
          
Initial State: User has existing spending data and submitted items.

Input: User submits a receipt.
          
Output: System provides an interface showing all purchased items along with price, location, and date-time.

Test Case Derivation: System must provide the user with all of the data that the user has provided the system such that the user can review their own purchasing data.
          
How test will be performed: Tester will submit a receipt and then verify to see that the items have been added in the purchases interface along with all of the preexisting items.

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box

\newpage{}
\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.}

  For the verification and validation of this project, several skills will be required
  to ensure that this project is well-tested and meets all requirements. This will involve
  some general testing knowledge as well as some knowledge specific to the technologies we
  are using. By learning the following, the team will be able to produce a better project for this
  capstone in addition to more confidence in the testing process in our careers.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Knowledge of the different forms and approaches of dynamic testing
    \item Knowledge of the different forms and approaches of static testing
    \item Experience and knowledge working with \textit{Flutter's} internal unit testing framework and
    \textit{Flutter Performance Profiling} for frontend performance
    \item Experience and knowledge using \textit{Postman} for backend tests
    \item Communication skills to write surveys and elicit feedback from stakeholders/testers
  \end{enumerate}

  \item \textbf{For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?}

  For skills \textit{(a)} and \textit{(b)}, one approach that could be taken is to review notes from
  \textit{SFWRENG 3S03} where topics such as dynamic and static testing were covered. The different
  approaches for dynamic and static testing were also part of the lecture material which would be useful to go over again.
  Additionally, articles can also be found on the internet covering the basics of these
  testing approaches. \par

  Skills \textit{(c)} and \textit{(d)} involve more specific technologies, so one approach to learning these
  could be to read documentation. For both technologies, documentation is present to learn how the
  developers had intended them to be used. Additionally, \textit{YouTube} tutorials can be referenced to
  go over the basics and learn these technologies. Considering how many tutorials are made by users, it
  could provide more insight on how these applications can be used in a more practical setting.
  Lastly, third-party articles can also be used for additional learning. \par

  Finally, skill \textit{(e)} is more of a social skill rather than a technical skill compared to the other skills listed.
  One way to improve communication skills for testing could be with group collaboration and
  interaction. For instance, before using a survey, getting it reviewed by the team could result in flaws or issues
  being identified which can be noted for the future. Furthermore, \textit{SFWRENG 3S03} had some lectures on surveys
  (such as the kinds of questions to ask and not ask) and similar testing approaches that could also be reviewed to better
  learn and improve this skill.

  Below are the chosen skills from each team member, their rationale, and approaches they will use to learn or
  improve said skills.

  \textbf{Ryan Yeh}\\
  \textit{Chosen Skills: (c), (d), (e)} \\
  For verification and validation, I will be taking a leadership role in designing unit tests and software
  validation. Therefore, I want to ensure familiarity with \textit{Flutter's} testing technology and \textit{Postman}
  given that unit tests will primarily utilize these technologies. By ensuring proper learning of
  this software, I should be able to better guide the rest of the team during unit test development resulting
  in a stronger test suite. In addition, I also chose communication skills as a skill to focus on since this application
  is primarily user-focused. Therefore, ensuring proper user feedback and testing with stakeholders will be very important
  to this app's success. \par
  To learn and improve my skills with \textit{Flutter's} testing software and \textit{Postman}, I will refer to the
  official documentation and \textit{YouTube} tutorials. I feel this will give me a balance between original developer
  knowledge and practical user knowledge. In terms of communication skills, I will be employing group feedback
  and collaboration to ensure high-quality questions are being asked to maximize the feedback and information we receive
  from stakeholders and testers.
