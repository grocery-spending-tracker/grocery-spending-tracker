\section{Introduction}
This document details the hazards and the associated hazard controls for the Grocery Spending Tracker system to mitigate and eliminate unsafe behaviour. The Grocery Spending Tracker will assist users in making smart grocery decisions to better manage household and grocery expenses.  A hazard is defined as some system condition(s) that, together with some environmental condition(s) has the potential to cause loss of some value to stakeholders. A hazard control is a measure to mitigate the hazard.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}
The scope of the document is to identify possible hazards within the system components, the steps to mitigate the hazards, and the resulting safety and security requirements.

\section{System Boundaries and Components}
The system that this hazard analysis will be conducted on consists of the following components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item The front-end and back-end components of the application:
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Authentication
            \item Purchase data input (including optical recognition and language models)
            \item Nearby alternatives recommendations
            \item Purchase history reports
            \item Spending objectives
        \end{itemize}
    \item User mobile device
    \item The database storing all application data
\end{itemize}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}
