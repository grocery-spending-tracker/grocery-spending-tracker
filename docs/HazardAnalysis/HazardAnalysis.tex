\section{Introduction}
This document details the hazards and the associated hazard controls for the Grocery Spending Tracker system to mitigate and eliminate unsafe behaviour. The Grocery Spending Tracker will assist users in making smart grocery decision to better manage household and grocery expenses.  A hazard is defined as a property or condition that has the potential to cause harm or damage when in the environment. A hazard control is a measure to mitigate the hazard.

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}
