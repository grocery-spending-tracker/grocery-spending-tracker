\section{Introduction}

\wss{You can include your definition of what a hazard is here.}

\section{Scope and Purpose of Hazard Analysis}

\section{System Boundaries and Components}

\section{Critical Assumptions}

\wss{These assumptions that are made about the software or system.  You should
minimize the number of assumptions that remove potential hazards.  For instance,
you could assume a part will never fail, but it is generally better to include
this potential failure mode.}

\section{Failure Mode and Effect Analysis}

\wss{Include your FMEA table here}

\section{Safety and Security Requirements}

\wss{Newly discovered requirements.  These should also be added to the SRS.  (A
rationale design process how and why to fake it.)}

\section{Roadmap}

\wss{Which safety requirements will be implemented as part of the capstone timeline?
Which requirements will be implemented in the future?}
