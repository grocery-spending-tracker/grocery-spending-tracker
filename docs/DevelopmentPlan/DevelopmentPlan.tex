\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

\subsection{Discord}

The primary means for communication will be the team \emph{Discord} server. In an effort to 
ensure team members are up-to-date with messages and discussion, everyone is expected to check \emph{Discord}
at least once per day and respond to direct messages within 24 hours.
Additionally, the server has been organized in such a way that different topics are separated into different channels. 
For general  discussion and planning, the \emph{general} channel will be used. When requesting reviewers on pull requests, 
the \emph{pull-request} channel should be used. Discussion surrounding bugs and issues will be brought up in the 
\emph{bugs-issues} channel. Discussion of progress updates for upcoming deliverables will go into the
\emph{status-updates} channel and lastly, any requests for help regarding work items will go into the \emph{help} channel.

\subsection{SMS}

Should the team require urgent or time sensitive contact with any members, \emph{SMS} will be used as the method 
of communication. \emph{SMS} should facilitate faster and more efficient communication compared to \emph{Discord} 
and will be used in events such as unforeseen issues with meeting availability or last-minute changes for deadlines.

\subsection{Github}

Github will be used to facilitate more technical code-related discussions via pull requests in addition to 
keeping track of work items using the issue tracker. The issue tracker will also be used to store notes from 
all group meetings.

you will be able to overcome this risk?

\section{Technology}

\begin{itemize}
\item Specific programming language
\item Specific linter tool (if appropriate)
\item Specific unit testing framework
\item Investigation of code coverage measuring tools
\item Specific plans for Continuous Integration (CI), or an explanation that CI
  is not being done
\item Specific performance measuring tools (like Valgrind), if
  appropriate
