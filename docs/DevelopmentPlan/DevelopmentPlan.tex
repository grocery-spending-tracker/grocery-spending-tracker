\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

The primary means for communication will be the team \emph{Discord} server. In an effort to 
ensure team members are up-to-date with messages and discussion, everyone is expected to check \emph{Discord}
at least once per day and respond to direct messages within 24 hours.
Additionally, the server has been organized in such a way that different topics are separated into different channels. 
For general  discussion and planning, the \emph{general} channel will be used. When requesting reviewers on pull requests, 
the \emph{pull-request} channel should be used. Any bugs and issues that require group consultation will go 
into the \emph{bugs-issues} channel. Discussion of progress updates for upcoming deliverables will go into the
\emph{status-updates} channel and lastly, any requests for help regarding work items will go into the \emph{help} channel.
If urgent contact with group members is required, \emph{SMS} should be used.

\section{Team Member Roles}
Individuals will take leadership in their respective assigned areas. In development, all members are responsible for adjusting and filling roles as the project evolves. All team meetings will have a scrum master and a scribe, rotated on a per meeting basis.
