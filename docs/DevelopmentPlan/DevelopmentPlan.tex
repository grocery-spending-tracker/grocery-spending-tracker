\section{Team Meeting Plan}

\item Standup meetings are scheduled weekly from \textbf{12:30 PM to 1:30 PM every Wednesday}. The primary meeting location is the \emph{H.G. Thode Library of Science \& Engineering}. However, in specific circumstances and within certain limitations, the meeting location may be shifted to \emph{Discord}.
    \item Sprint review meetings are scheduled weekly from \textbf{5:00 PM to 6:00 PM every Sunday}. The meeting location is \emph{Discord}.
    \item The roles and agendas for the next meeting will be decided in the final minutes of each meeting.
    \item Requests for additional meetings outside of regular scheduled meetings must be made and communicated at least \textbf{1 day in advance}.
    \item The Chair of the meeting is responsible for preparing the task backlog and identifying any relevant issues prior to the meeting.
\end{itemize}

\section{Team Communication Plan}

The primary means for communication will be the team \emph{Discord} server. In an effort to
ensure team members are up-to-date with messages and discussion, everyone is expected to check \emph{Discord}
at least once per day and respond to direct messages within 24 hours.
Additionally, the server has been organized in such a way that different topics are separated into different channels.
For general  discussion and planning, the \emph{general} channel will be used. When requesting reviewers on pull requests,
the \emph{pull-request} channel should be used. Any bugs and issues that require group consultation will go
into the \emph{bugs-issues} channel. Discussion of progress updates for upcoming deliverables will go into the
\emph{status-updates} channel and lastly, any requests for help regarding work items will go into the \emph{help} channel.
If urgent contact with group members is required, \emph{SMS} should be used.
