\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\lips
\section{Stakeholders}
\subsection{Client}
Both the client and customer will be the users of the system. These primary stakeholders are made up of low-income households of Hamilton and university students from McMaster who want to save money on groceries. The stakeholders will make decisions that influence the system through surveys, studies, and focus groups.
\subsection{Customer}
Outlined in the above Client section.
\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Grocery stores in the area
  \item Household members (people who the groceies are being purchased for)
  \item Mobile application store (ios app store, google play store)
  \item Any invidividual who wants to save on groceries
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
Low income households and individuals who are budget constrained on their groceries. The archetypal customer will have access to a device with a camera and have access to the internet. This entails adults or young adults who are responsible for making decisions on grocery items. Customers want to reduce the cost of their grocery items whilst maximizing the convenience of their grocery shopping trip. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Low or single income households in Hamilton
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shops for household groceries.
    \item Moderate experience with navigation mobile applications.
    \item 30-70 years of age.
    \item Has vehicle or some means to travel.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Students of McMaster University
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shops for individual groceries
    \item Adept experience with navigation mobile applications.
    \item 20-30 years of age.
    \item Has no vehicle or limited means to travel.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Personas}
\begin{itemize}
  \item John Bertuzzi
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Age: 22
    \item Favorite food: Chicken and Pasta
    \item Nursing Student at McMaster University
    \item Living in Ainslie Wood East.
    \item Athlete.
    \item Missing teeth.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Alice Woll
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Age: 51
    \item Favorite food: Grilled Cheese
    \item Mother of 2, Spouse of William Woll.
    \item Accountant for tech company.
    \item Living in Westdale.
    \item Likes to watch Hockey.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
All users will have equal priority within the system.

\subsection{User Participation}
Everyday users will provide their shopping data to the community database. This will be of no additional time commitment than they are already required to use the system at a base level.

From an elicitation perspective, a sample of users will be responsible for providing usability, look, and feel requirements feedback. This will be done at various stages in development.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
