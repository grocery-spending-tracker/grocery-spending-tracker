\section{Purpose of the Project}
\subsection{User Business}

With the world currently facing record high inflation, cost-of-living is at the highest
it has ever been. This affects all daily necessities but is especially true for food and groceries.
As a whole, all households are affected but there is particular financial strain on those with lower-incomes.
As a result, interest in personal finance has grown and become more important in peoples' everyday lives.
To assist these individuals, we are developing an application that can help users better understand their
spending habits and make smarter financial decisions. This application will allow users to
take photos of grocery receipts and track their overall spending, analyze spending trends, and receive
suggestions on cheaper alternatives for purchased grocery items. Overall, we believe this application
will help users stay more informed and reduce grocery spending in the long-term.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The created application will help users save money on groceries over time.
  \item The application will provide accurate spending data and suggestions to end users.
\end{itemize}

\medskip
\noindent \textbf{Title:} Sign into application\\
\textbf{Trigger:} User wants to sign into their account\\
\textbf{Pre-condition:} User has an account for the application\\
\textbf{Outcome:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item User enters their email and password when prompted and submits the data.
  \item System looks for any accounts with matching credentials.
  \item If a match is found, system authentication is successful and user is granted application access.
  \item If no match is found, system authentication fails and user is prompted with an error.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
\noindent \textbf{Title:} Enter spending goals\\
\textbf{Trigger:} User wants to enter their spending goals for the application\\
\textbf{Pre-condition:} User is signed into an account\\
\textbf{Outcome:}

\textbf{Pre-condition:} The user is logged in and has entered their budgeting preferences into the application\\
\textbf{Outcome:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The system analyzes purchase history and compares it to the user's
  budgeting preferences
  \item The system suggests items to stop purchasing and/or cheaper grocery alternatives
  if they exist \textit{(see Individual Product Use Case for "Suggest cheaper grocery
  alternatives")}.
\end{enumerate}

\medskip
\noindent \textbf{Title:} Suggest cheaper grocery alternatives\\
\textbf{Trigger:} A recently purchased item by the user is purchased at a cheaper price\\
\textbf{Pre-condition:} A database entry for the recently purchased item and spending data exist\\
\textbf{Outcome:}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item The system analyzes recent purchase history of the item as well as purchase location from different users.
  \item If the location is within the current user's location preferences, the item, price and location are
  prompted to the user.
  \item If the location is not within the current user's location preferences, no prompt is created.

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
\end{enumerate}
