\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Ryan Yeh:} I would like to note that I have my own \LaTeX{} environment on my local machine
  which allows me to commit more frequently than others. I generally also commit more than my teammates where
  not all my commits are necessarily significant changes.
\end{itemize}


\section{Issue Tracker}

% \wss{For each team member how many issues have they authored (including open and
% closed issues (O+C)) and how many have they been assigned (only counting closed
% issues (C only)). The time period of interest is since the Rev 0 demo.}

Allan Fang & 50 & 31 \\
Ryan Yeh & 22 & 29 \\
Sawyer Tang & 10 & 24 \\
\bottomrule
\end{tabular}
\end{table}

% \wss{If needed, an explanation for the counts can be provided here.}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Jason Nam:} I would like to clarify that the bulk of my contributions was directed to separate repositories, specifically for classification tasks and backend development, which can be found \href{https://github.com/grocery-spending-tracker/grocery-spending-tracker-classification}{here} and \href{https://github.com/grocery-spending-tracker/grocery-spending-tracker-backend}{here}. As a result, I did not maintain a comprehensive record of issue resolutions in the main repository, located \href{https://github.com/r-yeh/grocery-spending-tracker}{here}. I acknowledge this oversight.
