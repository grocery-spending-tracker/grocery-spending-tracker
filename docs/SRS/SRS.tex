\section{Purpose of the Project}

This section will go cover the reason for creating this project by going over the user business and application as well
as its goals.

\subsection{User Business}

With the world currently facing record high inflation, cost-of-living is among the highest
it has ever been. This affects all daily necessities but is especially true for food and groceries.
According to Statistics Canada, cost of groceries between March and April 2023 were 20\% higher than they were
two years ago [1]. More recently, grocery inflation was at 5.4\% year-over-year in October indicating how groceries
are only continuing to increase in price [2].
As a whole, all households are affected but there is particular financial strain on those with lower-incomes.
As a result, interest in personal finance has grown and become more important in peoples' everyday lives.
To assist these individuals, we are developing an application that can help users better understand their
spending habits and make smarter financial decisions. This application will allow users to
take photos of grocery receipts and track their overall spending, analyze spending trends, and receive
suggestions on cheaper alternatives for purchased grocery items. Overall, we believe this application
will help users stay more informed and reduce grocery spending in the long-term.

\subsection{Goals of the Project}
\begin{itemize}
  \item The created application will help users save money on groceries over time.
  \item The application will provide accurate spending data and suggestions to end users.
\end{itemize}  
\section{Stakeholders}

This section will go over the various stakeholders involved in the project including the actual users
and personas for the application.

\subsection{Client}
Both the client and customer will be the users of the system. These primary stakeholders are made up of low-income households of Hamilton and university students from McMaster who want to save money on groceries. The stakeholders will make decisions that influence the system through surveys, studies, and focus groups.
\subsection{Customer}
Outlined in the above Client section.
\subsection{Other Stakeholders}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Grocery stores in the area
  \item Household members (people who the groceries are being purchased for)
  \item Mobile application stores (iOS app store, Google Play Store)
  \item Any individuals who wants to save on groceries
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Hands-On Users of the Project}
Low income households and individuals who are budget constrained on their groceries. The archetypal customer will have access to a device with a camera and have access to the internet. This entails adults or young adults who are responsible for making decisions on grocery items. Customers want to reduce the cost of their grocery items whilst maximizing the convenience of their grocery shopping trip. 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Low or single income households in Hamilton
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shops for household groceries.
    \item Moderate experience with navigation mobile applications.
    \item 30-70 years of age.
    \item Has vehicle or some means to travel.
  \end{itemize}
  \item Students of McMaster University
  \begin{itemize}
    \item Shops for individual groceries
    \item Adept experience with navigation mobile applications.
    \item 20-30 years of age.
    \item Has no vehicle or limited means to travel.
  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

  \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Priorities Assigned to Users}
All users will have equal priority within the system.

\subsection{User Participation}
Everyday users will provide their shopping data to the community database. This will be of no additional time commitment than they are already required to use the system at a base level.

From an elicitation perspective, a sample of users will be responsible for providing usability, look, and feel requirements feedback. This will be done at various stages in development.

\section{Mandated Constraints}

This section summarizes the various constraints involved in this project as well as the expected
implementation environment and off-the-shelf software that could be leveraged.

\subsection{Solution Constraints}
\textbf{Mobile Device}\\
\underline{Description}: User will interact with the system through an app on their mobile device (smartphone).\\
\underline{Rationale}: Mobile devices are widely used and ubiquitous. While at a grocery store, users may need access to the system.\\
\underline{Fit Criterion}: User interface will run entirely on a mobile device.\\
\\
\textbf{Internet Access}\\ %%todo: is this too solution specific?
\underline{Description}: User must have internet access.\\
\underline{Rationale}: System servers and databases are used to store collective user data and process that data. User's devices are required to communicate with the servers and databases via internet access.\\
\underline{Fit Criterion}: User interface will have internet access.\\
\\
\textbf{Device with Camera}\\
\underline{Description}: User must be equipped with a device that has a camera. This should be quite common as most smartphones have a camera.\\
\underline{Rationale}: Users will be using the system while they are out on their grocery trips. Thus, the system needs to have a quick and easy method of data input. This also makes it easier for those who have their hands full or do not have the finger mobility to effectively type on their phone keyboards.\\
\underline{Fit Criterion}: System must have access to a mobile camera.\\

\subsection{Planning of the Development Phases}

Development is being split into three phases based on an overarching goal for each: the Proof of Concept build,
the Revision 0 build, and the Revision 1 build. \par

The first development phase has a focus on initial documentation and implementation.
Rather than building a full app at the phase, development will involve familiarization with
the technology and constructing core features to prove the concept is feasible. This phase will
end with the Proof of Concept Demonstration where the feasibility will be proven to stakeholders.
Priorities will largely be based on deadlines and will largely follow the set deadlines by the
course instructor. As shown below, moving forward, documentation will take priority while
development for the Proof of Concept build occurs concurrently. In other words, writing the
the necessary documents will take priority and any spare time will be spent developing. Once
the final document deadline of this period is reached, development will be focused on until
the demo date. \par

The second phase of development will focus on design of the application and constructing the
Revision 0 build of the application. With the initial functionality from the first development phase as
a starting point, the actual app structure will be built around it. This will include more UI/UX
development as well as additional features that are needed for the Revision 0 version. This phase ends
with the Revision 0 Demonstration where stakeholders can see the first iteration of the full application
and provide feedback. Priority will be given to the Revision 0 build during this phase due to most
of the documentation already being completed in the previous phase.
This will continue until January 1 where the team will shift priority to the Design Documentation due to
the earlier deadline. After completion, the team will continue working on the Revision 0 build until
the demo date on February 5. \par

The third phase of development is focused on reviewing Revision 0 and iterating on feedback from the
Revision 0 Demonstration. Here, documentation will be reviewed and finalized based on any changes made
during development. Furthermore, no new large-scale features will be implemented. Instead, development
will be restricted to improving the Revision 0 version and implementing feedback from stakeholders. This phase
will end with the Revision 1 Demonstration and submission of the finalized Revision 1 Documentation. Priority
will be first given to the V\&V Report due to it having the earliest deadline along with development for the Revision 1
build occurring concurrently at a lower priority. Once the V\&V report is completed, the Revision 1 Build will take priority
until the demo with Revision 1 Documentation occurring concurrently in March. Once the demo is completed, the team will
continue to finalize documentation until its deadline.

\section{Costs}
The team currently has no intention of spending money and aims to utilize free software and technology
for this project.

\section{User Documentation and Training}

This section goes over the user documentation and training requirements for the project.

\subsection{User Documentation Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The application shall give detailed instructions on how to use the application in user manuals or guides. Registration, sign-in, data entry, budgeting, spending analysis, and any other key features should all be included in this documentation.
    \item The application shall offer a FAQ section that answers to frequent user issues and inquiries. This can enable users to quickly find answers to their problems without the need for outside assistance.
    \item The application shall offer a troubleshooting guide that details common problems and how to fix them. This should include technical difficulties, login issues, and data sync issues.
    \item The application shall inform users on how to stay up to speed with software updates and new features. Include release notes that describe the additions and modifications done in each update.
\end{itemize}
\subsection{Training Requirements}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The application shall provide on-boarding content that new users can access when they initially register for the application, such as tutorial videos or guidelines. These resources should to make it easier for users to learn the basic features.
    \item The application shall clearly communicate the available user support channels, such as a customer support email, chat, or phone number. Users should be made aware of where to look for assistance when they run into problems.
    \item The application shall provide a system that will allow users to comment on the documentation and training materials. The training procedure and documentation quality can be continually improved with the help of this feedback.
\end{itemize}

\section{Waiting Room}
At the moment, there are no requirements or features being excluded from the initial version.

\section{Ideas for Solution}
Some initial ideas for the implementation that the team came up with are as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item Application will utilize \textit{node-rsa} to handle encryption and security for user data.
    \item Front-end will use MVVM architecture.
    \item Natural language processing will be used to assist mapping from receipts to the database.
\end{itemize}

\section*{Appendix A --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Lifelong Learning.  Please answer the following questions:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.}

  For this application, many skills will be required in order to ensure this
  project's success. This includes a combination of project specific knowledge
  as well as a few less technical skills. Together, these skills will ensure the
  smooth development of our application but will also likely prove useful in the future
  as we move forward with our careers.
  \begin{enumerate}
    \item Working knowledge of \textit{Flutter} development and front-end design
    \item Knowledge working with \textit{Node.js} backends and REST APIs
    \item Skills related to the use of the \textit{Tesseract-OCR} engine
    \item Working knowledge of \textit{PostgreSQL}
    \item Experience working with Natural Language Processing or Machine Learning
    \item Writing proper software documentation
    \item Familiarity and experience with software testing/coverage
    \item Presentation and communication skills for elicitation and demos
  \end{enumerate}  

  \item \textbf{For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?}

  For the above skills, there are many approaches that could be taken to learning
  and developing them. In terms of skills \textit{(a)} to \textit{(e)}, these would be categorized as
  development oriented skills. These would involve knowledge that could directly apply to
  the technology being employed for this capstone project. Since these are each popular
  technologies in their own right, many resources could be accessed to learn about them. Watching
  \textit{YouTube} videos and tutorials would be one resource that could be used to strengthen
  and learn these skills. \textit{YouTube} tutorials often provide more practical applications
  for the skill in question and the site has content that covers a wide variety of topics.
  Additionally, official documentation could be read in order to see how the original developers intend
  the technology to be used. This would provide a more in-depth understanding of each aspect of the
  technology. There are also plenty of third-party online articles and forums that could be referenced when
  learning these types of skills. One last approach that could be taken is referencing open-source
  projects using these technologies to see how they are used in real development.\par

  Skills \textit{(f)} and \textit{(g)} are technical but less directly involved with the coding portion
  of development. Despite this, there are still plenty of resources that could be used to learn and
  familiarize ourselves with them. One place to look could be previous coursework, in particular,
  \textit{SFWRENG 3RA3} and \textit{SFWRENG 3S03} notes could be used to reference documentation and
  software testing respectively. Furthermore, resources for these topics also exist on \textit{YouTube}
  which could be leveraged in addition to third-party articles. One last resource could also be to leverage
  group work and collaboration. This would provide active engagement as well as opportunity
  for feedback to improve these skills.\par

  Lastly, skill \textit{(h)} is a general skill that is important for all engineers to be comfortable
  with. One approach to mastering this skill could be practical applications, including but not limited to holding
  mock presentations or focus groups with the team. Practicing presentations and communication is one of the
  easiest ways to help develop this skill. Moreover, there are many seminars and courses online that help
  teach strong communication practices such as ones on \textit{Coursera} or \textit{LinkedIn Learning}.\par

  With these in consideration, each team member has listed their chosen skills, their chosen approaches from above,
  and why they chose to pursue these skills below.

  \textbf{Ryan Yeh}\\
  \textit{Chosen Skills: (a), (f), (g), (h)} \\
  At the beginning of this project, I was assigned as the lead for documentation and testing. As such,
  I would like to take the opportunity to strengthen my understanding of these skills in order to meet my team's
  expectations. Outside of this project though, I believe these skills will be very helpful regardless of what type
  of developer I end up becoming. Additionally, I wanted to strengthen my understanding and skills in front-end
  development. UI design is a software field that I have an interest in but lack sufficient experience currently.
  Therefore, I would love to take this opportunity to learn more about it and strengthen my understanding of it. Lastly,
  I chose communication skills as something to focus on due to my belief that it is something I could improve upon.
  Communication and presentation skills will always be universally needed and putting an emphasis on it now would greatly
  help me in the future. \par
  My approach for developing my documentation and software testing skills will be to refer to previous year course notes.
  This will help me to reinforce the material I have already learned and refresh myself on topics I may have forgotten.
  I also plan to read third-party articles as a supplement to learn more about certain
  topics that may not have been covered in as much detail in class. For \textit{Flutter} and front-end design,
  I plan to watch \textit{YouTube} tutorials in order to get more a hands-on experience with the technology. I also
  plan to reference documentation and articles in order to further my learning beyond the videos watched. Finally,
  I will leverage my group in order to strengthen my communication skills. I will try and place myself into positions
  that force me to practice communication such as leading meetings, as well as practicing presentations with the
  rest of my team.

  \medskip
  \textbf{Sawyer Tang}\\
  \textit{Chosen Skills: (a), (b), (d), (h)} \\
  For this project, I was assigned to backend development. In following this, I am choosing to improve my abilities in \textit{NodeJS} and \textit{SQL}. I have used some of these technologies in brevity over my past internship positions but I am looking to deepen my experience with them further with the hopes of bringing this experience to future personal projects and jobs. 
  In addition to wanting to improve my backend skills, I also want to dive into front end. More specifically, mobile development in \textit{Flutter}. This is something that I have always had an interest in learning and this project seems to me like a perfect opportunity.
  Finally, I believe that being able to effectively communicate your ideas is an invaluable skill and it is something that I am always looking to improve for myself and career. \par
  My approach to gaining these frontend and backend skills will be to consume public documentation, online forums, and \textit{YouTube} video tutorials. For communication skills, I practice them every day during meetings or when working with team members. I also look to improve these skills during our team presentations and demos.

  \medskip
  \textbf{Jason Nam}\\
  \textit{Chosen Skills: (a), (c), (e), (g)}\\
  During the early stages of project team formation and idea generation, I was tasked with the job of undertaking feasibility studies related to implementing OCR for the team's project solution. At that point in time, I had extensive experience working with Machine Learning for Natural Language Processing. However, I had never had the opportunity to learn proper Machine Learning models related to OCR. I am eager to learn the workings behind OCR and how we can implement it in our project. I am also eager to further enhance my ML for NLP skills.
  Similar to my previous point, I also had the opportunity to experience full-stack development involving web development. However, I never had a chance to learn Mobile App development, especially front-end app development. I am confident I can utilize my skills from web development to transfer over to app development and improve from there on.
  Finally, I want a tangible skill I can acquire during the duration of this project. I believe that skills related to software testing and coverage will be very valuable later on in life. \par
  My approach to acquiring OCR and Machine Learning Recognition skills will involve extensively reading over the user manual for \textit{Tesseract OCR} package. Fortunately, there are many sources of information related to Tesseract OCR online in many different platforms, including \textit{YouTube}, \textit{Tesseract Github Repository}, and official user manuals. For app development using \textit{Flutter}, I want to start from the fundamentals. First, I will endeavor to learn \textit{Dart} programming language, which is the programming language behind \textit{Flutter}. Then, I will refer to many open source \textit{Flutter} development projects to familiarize myself with official \textit{Flutter} development. For software testing and coverage related skills, I will refer to previous course 3S03 - Software Testing course to re-acclimatize myself on the topic.

  \medskip
  \textbf{Allan Fang}\\
  \textit{Chosen Skills: (a), (c), (f), (h)} \\
  I will be the primary developer for the frontend and OCR portions of this project. For these skills (\textit{a} and \textit{c}), I will pursue both the approach of following tutorials and the approach of reading documentation. From past experiences, I have found that there is a knowledge aspect and execution aspect to skills similar to the aforementioned. While documentation is usually very comprehensive, I feel that it is necessary to supplement the learning process with additional material. Following or just watching a tutorial of these skills in action are usually good ways to fill in the knowledge gaps. \par
  For skills \textit{f} and \textit{h} that all groups members will be responsible for, I will be pursuing the approach of practice and feedback (which also includes referring to past course work). I believe that for these skills, practical application is most important. Actively engaging in these skills, along with consistent feedback and improvement, will allow me and my group mates to develop a deeper understanding of these skills in the personal application context. Furthermore, feedback from multiple sources can introduce broader perspectives previously unknown and will result in immediate improvements.

\end{enumerate}

\section*{Added Section - Appendix B --- Stakeholder Requirements Elicitation Notes}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{E1:} Consider your favourite or most used mobile apps, what elements of the UI
  stand out? What in your opinion makes an appealing user interface?

      \item Many apps borrow UI layouts from each other, helps with familiarity in terms of navigation.
      \item Always accessible navigation options.
      \item Proper organizing of features (unrelated features should be separated on the UI).
      \item Swipe navigation and minimal long presses.
      \item Saving state when closed to minimize user input on future uses.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{E3:} How important do you consider application feedback and what feedback would you
  expect from an application? (i.e. loading indicators)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item High importance to communicate errors and loading to users.
      \item Should always convey when issues happen or something is being done.
      \item When fetching information or other longer duration tasks, loading bar should be utilized.
      \item Utilization of messages or pop ups if resources are unavailable or something goes wrong.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{E4:} When learning a new app, how long would you consider a reasonable amount of time
  to consider an app easy-to-use?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Average acceptable time to consider an app intuitive would be to be able to figure
      out basic functionality within 15 minutes.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{E5:} What features would you want to help with the learning experience of a new app?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The use of a tutorial on first launch to take users through the UI and different features.
      \item The use of tooltips for certain options and features.

    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{E6:} How do you usually go about learning a new application?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All participants said they tend to brute force applications in order to learn
      (i.e. clicking around and seeing how the application responds).
      \item As an addition to this brute force approach, participants explained how useful an
      undo feature would be as well as always accessible navigation.
    \end{itemize}

  to complete? How long would you be willing to wait for an application before closing the app?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Ideally, regular operations should take a second or less.
      \item At most, participants would wait an average of 12 seconds before closing the app or
      thinking something went wrong.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{E9:} What kind of phone do you use? (Apple/Android/Other)
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All participants used Apple devices.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{E10:} On a scale of 1-10, for an app of this nature, how important would you consider accuracy
  of the system and data? How important would you consider responsiveness on the same scale?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item All participants considered accuracy of the features and data to be the most important (10) due
      to the financial aspect of the app.
      \item Responsiveness was considered important (8) in order to ensure a positive user experience. If the
      app does not feel good to use, most participants said they would find another app instead.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{E11:} How much do you consider the size of an application you install? How big of an app would you
  consider reasonable?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Most participants said they did not pay much attention to the size of applications when installing
      them.
      \item Participants said they would consider anything over 1GB unreasonable for an app of this nature.
    \end{itemize}
  \item \textbf{E12:} For an app of this nature, what features or points of interest come to mind based on your identity as a Canadian?
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Participant stated imperial and metric units are hard to navigate as Canada uses a unique mix. 
      them.
      \item Participant stated that culturally unique grocery items (such as Chinese vegetables) need to be included.
